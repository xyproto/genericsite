genericsite
===========

Generic website library with search and user administration.

Not the prettiest of libraries, it's part of an experiment in procedural generation of websites.


Features and limitations
------------------------

* Uses procedural generation of html and css extensively. Templates would probably be a better solution for the future.
* User login and registration system
* Email confirmation system
* Admin panel
* Subpages
* Native speed


Templates
---------

* Must be placed in /usr/share/templates, for now
